    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a junior mechanical engineer.</p>
    <p>So why am I writing a website that's primarily interested in computer science? Well, while completing an internship during my degree, I decided that I wanted to learn how computers work. I had always been <q>pretty good</q> with computers and electronics, so I figured I should pursue that interest (when I figured out how to connect the VCR to the TV, my mother implicitly dubbed (branded?) me the resident IT guy for life, a true rite-of-passage for the even mildly tech-savvy). I picked up a copy of the classic <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language</a></cite> by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, and, while it was difficult to get through, I eventually finished it, and even understood some of it. At that point computers were still essentially black-boxes to me, and I still had next to no idea what went on inside them, but I had learned something, and I was hooked by the subject (baby steps). Ever since, I have taught myself a lot about computer science over the past few years by studying the subject on and off, sometimes intensely, sometimes lazily.</p>
    <p>So my website isn't about mechanical engineering because I do mechanical engineering at work. I think there's something to be said for keeping your work separate from your hobbies.
    <p>So to be more precise, I should say that I'm a junior mechanical engineer <em>who studies computer science for fun</em>. Weird? Yes. Interesting? To some, maybe.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>The more pessimistic reader may be wondering why I'm writing a blog at all. Well, now that I've introduced myself, I can hopefully write my holier-than-thou spiel without sounding like a total snob. Here goes.</p>
    <p>In its early days, the outlook on the internet's future was bright. Instant access to information was expected to change everything for the better. It would make nations more democratic because everyone's voice would be heard. It would allow anyone to learn about anything they wanted, making education cheaper and more accessible. Unfortunately, the internet of the present day reflects a somewhat different reality. For many, the internet is little more than a source of entertainment, a time-waster. For those who are motivated to learn, however, it can be a truly wonderful resource.</p>
    <p>This website has many goals, all of which it shall perform poorly. First and foremost, it will be an opportunity for me to learn web development, which is one step in my journey. Next, it will grant me a chance to share my experiences learning about computers, without having to spend a dime. Finally, I want it to be a platform for me to share my projects.</p>
    <p>Sorry for making you read all that.</p>
